python scripts for data fixes

as of 03.20.13 contents include:
(1) skipblanks.py: script that says if value in field of spreadsheet/csv is blank, skip and only write fields with content                    into new file.

(2) tranpose_all.py: script that uses the iterator module to do a souped up version of zip (izip) that will transpose all                      rows of data into columns in your new file.

(3) transpose_some.py: script that parses x rows of data (not all) into x columns and in this instance, fills additional
                       corresponding columns with specified data.
